* Rotary encoder and ultrasound code
** I2C interface
*** Write
Writes always set the rotary encoder number for the next read.
*** Read
Reads read the ticks, as a signed char, since the last read. It also
increments the current rotary encoder
** RE numbers
0 is the left wheel
1 is the right wheel
2 is US 1
3 is US 2
** Timers
Timer 1 is used for ultrasound.  To start US: 

-Set pulse pin 

-Clear timer 1

-CCP1 in compare mode will interrupt when timer reaches
 TIMER_PULSE_STOP

-The update_us() function repeatedly checks the echo pin, setting the
 distance when it ends

-update_us() waits until timer 1 reaches TIMER_RESET, then repeats
** Pins
*** PORTC
RC0 - pulse pin 0
RC1 - echo pin 0
RC2 - pulse pin 1
RC3 - echo pin 1
*** PORTA
RA0 - pin A 0 (left)
RA1 - pin B 0 (left)
RA2 - pin A 1 (right)
RA3 - pin B 1 (right)
RA4 - i2c SCL
RA5 - i2c SDA
