* Revolver servo code
** I2C interface
*** Write
Writes always sets the values of the servos
Each bit sets a servo:
-bits 0:3 set the revolver servos (1=grabbed)
-bit 5 sets the flag servo (1=up)
*** Read
Reads return the equivalent to what was written.
** Timers
Timer 1 is used for timing the servo
Runs at 2MHz,overflows at 40,000
1ms = 2000
1.5ms = 3000
2ms = 4000
The CCP in compare mode generates an interrupt at each significant
event, which will set the value for the next compare to the next
value.
** Pins
*** PORTC
RCx - servo x
*** PORTA
RA4 - i2c SCL
RA5 - i2c SDA
